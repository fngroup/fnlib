# Fnlib - A simple specification for FaaS.

## Function as a Service Lib

Fllib(Function Lib) is a simple specification that is designed to make it easy for individual developers and businesses to use it as a reference to implement specific functionality.

Only one client usage protocol is defined by fnlib, so fnlib doesn't care how your server is implemented. In order to give developers the best experience, it is best to follow the fnlib specification at the interface level.

The specification of fnlib includes API gateway, function context, function parameters, HTTP request, error handling, security, and GraphQL.

## What is FaaS?

Function as a service (FaaS) refers to cloud services that enable serverless app development and management. This basically means that FaaS users are able to conduct their programming (and other tasks) without the hassle of managing their own server(s). Strings of code are triggered by events on the user end, and basically outsourced to remote servers that are able to execute the intended functions.

FaaS was first introduced in 2014 with hook.io, but was popularized by Amazonâ€™s AWS Lambda, as well as Google Cloud Functions and Microsoft Azure Functions. In addition to those, IBM has an open-source FaaS system called OpenWhisk, and the rideshare company Uber has a FaaS that runs over their private platform.

In addition to US companies, China's Aliyun and Tencent Cloud have also launched the FaaS platform, in addition to two startups doing related work (bomb and miniapp cloud).
